			<p><b>Hash: </b>A password hash is a mathematical function that transforms a password into a fixed-length string of characters, which is then stored in a database. It is used to protect user passwords by making it difficult for attackers to recover the original password from the hash.</p>
			<p><b>Salt: </b>A salt is a random string of characters that is added to a password before it is hashed. It is used to increase the complexity of the hash and make it harder for attackers to use precomputed lookup tables to crack the password.</p>
			<p><b>Emotet Trojan Malware: </b>Emotet is a trojan malware that is primarily spread through spam emails and malicious attachments. Once installed on a system, it can download and install additional malware, steal sensitive information, and spread to other machines on the network.
